      question: "Could you explain the difference between 'let', 'const', and 'var', and what block scoping means?",
      idealAnswer: "var is function-scoped, can be re-declared, and is hoisted with undefined. let and const are block-scoped (only accessible inside the enclosing { }), cannot be re-declared in the same scope, and are hoisted to the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ). const additionally cannot be reassigned after declaration.",

    },
    {
      question: "What is the event loop in JavaScript, and how does it handle asynchronous operations?",
      idealAnswer: "The Event Loop enables non-blocking, single-threaded execution. Synchronous code runs in the Call Stack. Asynchronous tasks (like setTimeout, fetch) are handled by Web APIs and queued in the Callback/Task Queue or Microtask Queue. When the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop pushes tasks from the queues into the stack for execution.",

    },
    {
      question: "Can you explain what a closure is and provide a practical use case for it?",
      idealAnswer: "A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when executed outside that scope. It is created when an inner function references variables in an outer function. Practical use cases include data privacy (hiding variables from external access) and partial application/currying.",
      keywords: ['scope', 'inner', 'outer', 'function', 'lexical', 'remember', 'access']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between '==' and '===' in JavaScript, and why is one preferred?",
      idealAnswer: "== performs type coercion before comparing two values (converting them to a common type first), while === compares both the value and the type strictly without coercion. === is preferred to avoid unexpected coercion bugs (e.g. true == 1 is true, but true === 1 is false).",
      keywords: ['type', 'value', 'strict', 'equality', 'conversion', 'coerce']
    },
    {
      question: "How do promises work, and how does async/await syntax improve asynchronous code readability?",
      idealAnswer: "Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They have three states: Pending, Resolved, or Rejected. async/await is syntactic sugar over promises, allowing asynchronous code to be written sequentially and handled like synchronous code using try/catch, removing nested 'then/catch' chains.",
      keywords: ['resolve', 'reject', 'pending', 'async', 'await', 'then', 'catch']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code execution in JavaScript, and how does the browser event loop prevent blocking?",
      idealAnswer: "Synchronous code executes sequentially, blocking subsequent tasks until the current one finishes. Asynchronous code executes non-sequentially, offloading long-running tasks to the browser APIs and queuing callback tasks in the queue to run later when the call stack is empty. This prevents blocking the single main thread.",
      keywords: ['synchronous', 'asynchronous', 'block', 'non-blocking', 'thread', 'stack', 'queue']
    },
    {
      question: "Can you explain prototypal inheritance in JavaScript and how it differs from class-based inheritance?",
      idealAnswer: "Prototypal inheritance means objects inherit properties and methods directly from other objects via a prototype link (`__proto__`), forming a prototype chain. Class-based inheritance uses blueprints (classes) to create instances. JavaScript classes are syntactic sugar over prototypes.",
      keywords: ['prototype', 'inheritance', 'chain', 'class', 'sugar', 'delegate']
    },
    {
      question: "What are arrow functions, and how do they differ from regular functions regarding the 'this' context?",
      idealAnswer: "Arrow functions have a shorter syntax and do not bind their own 'this' value; instead, they inherit 'this' lexically from their enclosing scope. Regular functions bind 'this' dynamically based on how they are called (e.g., as a method, function, or constructor).",
      keywords: ['arrow', 'regular', 'function', 'this', 'lexical', 'bind', 'context']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between map, filter, and reduce methods on JavaScript arrays?",
      idealAnswer: "map creates a new array by transforming each element. filter creates a new array containing only elements that pass a conditional test. reduce executes a reducer function on each element, accumulating them into a single final value (e.g., number, object, or array).",
      keywords: ['map', 'filter', 'reduce', 'array', 'transform', 'accumulate', 'element']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript, and how does it relate to hoisting?",
      idealAnswer: "The TDZ is the period between a variable's block entry and its actual declaration. Variables declared with let and const are hoisted but not initialized, remaining in the TDZ. Accessing them before their declaration line throws a ReferenceError.",

    {
      question: "What are the main advantages of React's virtual DOM, and how does reconciliation work?",
      idealAnswer: "The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM. When state changes, React creates a new virtual tree, compares it with the previous virtual tree (Diffing), and updates only the changed nodes in the real DOM (Reconciliation). This minimizes expensive direct DOM manipulations, enhancing UI performance.",
      keywords: ['diff', 'reconcile', 'dom', 'update', 'ui', 'render', 'tree']
    },
    {
      question: "Could you explain the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?",
      idealAnswer: "Controlled components have their form state driven by React state via props (value and onChange handler), making React the single source of truth. Uncontrolled components store state in the DOM itself, and React accesses their values using refs (e.g. useRef) when needed, which is useful for simpler forms or third-party integrations.",
      keywords: ['state', 'ref', 'input', 'form', 'dom', 'value', 'change']
    },
    {
      question: "What are React Hooks, and what rules must be followed when using hooks like useEffect?",
      idealAnswer: "Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. The core rules of hooks are: 1) Only call hooks at the top level (never inside loops, conditions, or nested functions) to ensure consistent call order. 2) Only call hooks from React function components or custom hooks.",
      keywords: ['hook', 'state', 'effect', 'render', 'dependency', 'clean', 'mount']
    },
    {
      question: "How does context API differ from state management tools like Redux, and when would you use each?",
      idealAnswer: "Context API is a built-in React feature for passing data down the component tree without manual prop-drilling, suitable for low-frequency updates like themes or auth. Redux is an external library using a global store, actions, and reducers, designed for complex, high-frequency state updates, caching, middleware integration, and time-travel debugging.",
      keywords: ['store', 'provider', 'global', 'reducer', 'action', 'prop', 'drill']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of React.memo, and how does it optimize rendering performance?",
      idealAnswer: "React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes functional components. It prevents a component from re-rendering if its props have not changed, performing a shallow comparison of props by default. It is useful for pure components that render frequently with the same props.",
      keywords: ['memo', 'prop', 're-render', 'render', 'prev', 'next', 'compare']
    },
    {
      question: "How does React's virtual DOM diffing algorithm optimize updates, and what role do 'keys' play in list rendering?",
      idealAnswer: "React's diffing algorithm compares two virtual DOM trees element-by-element. Keys help React identify which list items have changed, been added, or been removed, preventing unnecessary re-renders of unmodified siblings and maintaining correct component state.",
      keywords: ['diff', 'key', 'render', 'list', 're-render', 'state', 'sibling']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback hooks, and when would you use each?",
      idealAnswer: "useEffect runs side effects after rendering. useMemo memoizes a computed value to avoid expensive calculations on every render. useCallback memoizes a function definition to prevent unnecessary child re-renders due to fresh function reference generation.",
      keywords: ['effect', 'memo', 'callback', 'render', 'hook', 'reference', 'expensive']
    },
    {
      question: "What is prop-drilling, and how do Context API or custom state libraries resolve it?",
      idealAnswer: "Prop-drilling is the practice of passing props through multiple levels of intermediate components that do not need the data. Context API solves this by providing a Provider wrapper that lets children consume state directly via useContext, bypassing intermediate nodes.",
      keywords: ['prop', 'drill', 'context', 'provider', 'consume', 'intermediate', 'tree']
    },
    {
      question: "What are React custom hooks, and why would you create one?",
      idealAnswer: "Custom hooks are JavaScript functions starting with 'use' that call other hooks. They enable extracting component logic into reusable, testable functions, allowing different components to share stateful logic without duplicating code.",
      keywords: ['custom', 'hook', 'reusable', 'extract', 'logic', 'share', 'stateful']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between useEffect's empty dependency array `[]` and not providing a dependency array at all?",
      idealAnswer: "An empty dependency array `[]` tells React to run the effect only once after the initial mount. Providing no dependency array at all tells React to run the effect after *every single render* of the component.",

    {
      question: "What is Node.js, and how does its non-blocking event-driven I/O model work?",
      idealAnswer: "Node.js is a runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine that runs JavaScript server-side. Its non-blocking I/O model delegates long-running tasks (like database queries or file system reads) to the system kernel or thread pool (via libuv). Once finished, the task triggers a callback on the event loop, letting Node handle thousands of concurrent requests on a single main thread.",
      keywords: ['loop', 'event', 'async', 'single', 'thread', 'callback', 'non-blocking']
    },
    {
      question: "What are Streams in Node.js, and what are the benefits of piping streams?",
      idealAnswer: "Streams are collections of data that are read or written sequentially in chunks, rather than loading the entire file into memory at once. Piping streams connects a readable stream directly to a writable stream, managing backpressure automatically and dramatically reducing memory consumption for large file transactions.",
      keywords: ['stream', 'pipe', 'chunk', 'memory', 'buffer', 'read', 'write']
    },
    {
      question: "Can you explain how middleware works in Express.js and give an example of custom middleware?",
      idealAnswer: "Middleware functions in Express have access to the Request (req) and Response (res) objects, and the next middleware function in the cycle (next). They can run code, modify req/res objects, end the request cycle, or pass control using next(). Example: a logger middleware doing `console.log(req.url); next();`.",
      keywords: ['request', 'response', 'next', 'req', 'res', 'cycle', 'route']
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle error propagation in asynchronous Node.js operations?",
      idealAnswer: "In async operations, errors are handled by: 1) passing them as the first argument in error-first callbacks, 2) catching them in promise chains using .catch(), or 3) enclosing async/await code in try/catch blocks. In Express, you pass async errors to next(err) so the error-handling middleware can catch and return them.",
      keywords: ['try', 'catch', 'promise', 'next', 'error', 'middleware', 'reject']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of package-lock.json, and why is it important in a team environment?",
      idealAnswer: "package-lock.json locks the exact version of every package and sub-dependency installed in the node_modules folder. This guarantees that all developers and build servers in a team environment install the exact same dependency tree, preventing 'works on my machine' version incompatibility issues.",
      keywords: ['version', 'dependency', 'lock', 'lockfile', 'install', 'team', 'deterministic']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of npm and package.json, and what is the difference between dependencies and devDependencies?",
      idealAnswer: "npm is Node's package manager. package.json holds project metadata and dependencies. dependencies are required for the application to run in production. devDependencies are only required for development and testing (e.g., linters, compilers, test runners).",
      keywords: ['npm', 'package', 'dependency', 'dev', 'production', 'metadata', 'install']
    },
    {
      question: "What is backpressure in Node.js streams, and how is it handled?",
      idealAnswer: "Backpressure occurs when a readable stream produces data faster than the writable stream can consume it. This causes data buffering in memory. Node handles this automatically when using the `.pipe()` method, pausing the reader until the writer clears its buffer.",
      keywords: ['backpressure', 'stream', 'pipe', 'buffer', 'read', 'write', 'pause', 'resume']
    },
    {
      question: "How does the cluster module in Node.js help in scaling applications?",
      idealAnswer: "The cluster module allows scaling Node applications horizontally across multiple CPU cores. Since Node runs on a single thread, clustering launches a master process that forks worker processes, all sharing the same server port and balancing load among workers.",
      keywords: ['cluster', 'scale', 'fork', 'worker', 'cpu', 'thread', 'load', 'balance']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the Event Emitter class in Node.js, and how do you use it?",
      idealAnswer: "EventEmitter is a core class that facilitates communication between objects in Node. It allows objects to emit named events that cause registered listener functions to run. You use it by importing `events`, extending the class, and calling `emit()` and `on()`.",
      keywords: ['emitter', 'event', 'listener', 'emit', 'on', 'register', 'subscribe']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between require() and import (ES modules) in Node.js?",
      idealAnswer: "require() is CommonJS (synchronous loading, dynamic imports allowed anywhere, returns module.exports). import is ES Modules (asynchronous loading, static analysis, parsed before execution, requires file extensions or package.json type config).",
      keywords: ['require', 'import', 'commonjs', 'esm', 'module', 'static', 'dynamic']
    }
  ],
  'python': [
    {
      question: "What is the difference between lists and tuples in Python, and when would you use each?",
      idealAnswer: "Lists are mutable (can be edited after creation, written with square brackets `[]`), whereas tuples are immutable (cannot be altered, written with parentheses `()`). Lists are used for dynamic collections of identical types. Tuples are used for fixed sequences of data, records, dictionary keys, and are faster and memory-efficient.",
      keywords: ['mutable', 'immutable', 'list', 'tuple', 'bracket', 'parenthes']
    },
    {
      question: "How does memory management work in Python, specifically regarding garbage collection?",
      idealAnswer: "Python manages memory automatically using reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector. Every object has a count of references pointing to it. When an object's reference count drops to zero, Python immediately deallocates it. The cyclic garbage collector runs periodically to detect and delete groups of objects with circular references.",
      keywords: ['garbage', 'reference', 'count', 'cycle', 'collector', 'alloc']
    },
    {
      question: "Can you explain decorators in Python and write a simple example of one?",
      idealAnswer: "A decorator is a design pattern in Python that wraps another function to extend or modify its behavior without permanently altering the code. It is written using the '@decorator_name' syntax. Example: \n```python\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper():\n        print('Before call')\n        func()\n        print('After call')\n    return wrapper\n```",
      keywords: ['decorator', 'wrap', 'function', 'arg', 'modify', 'behavi']
    },
    {
      question: "What are generators and yield statements in Python, and how do they save memory?",
      idealAnswer: "Generators are functions that return an iterator using the 'yield' statement instead of 'return'. Instead of computing all values at once and storing them in memory, yield pauses function execution and returns one value at a time on demand. This enables lazy evaluation, saving significant memory for massive or infinite sequences.",
      keywords: ['yield', 'generator', 'iterator', 'memory', 'lazy', 'next']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy in Python?",
      idealAnswer: "A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and inserts references to the original nested objects, meaning modifications to inner lists affect both copies. A deep copy recursively copies the original object and all nested objects, creating completely independent data structures with no shared references.",
      keywords: ['reference', 'copy', 'nested', 'object', 'recursive', 'clone']
    },
    {
      question: "What is PEP 8, and why is it important in the Python community?",
      idealAnswer: "PEP 8 is the official style guide for writing Python code. It defines conventions for indentation, naming, line length, and spacing, ensuring consistency, code readability, and easy collaboration across the Python community.",

    },
    {
      question: "What are list comprehensions in Python, and how do they differ from map/filter?",
      idealAnswer: "List comprehensions offer a concise syntax to create lists based on existing lists. E.g. `[x*2 for x in nums if x > 2]`. They combine map and filter operations, are often faster, and are considered more readable and 'Pythonic' than map/filter.",
      keywords: ['comprehension', 'list', 'map', 'filter', 'pythonic', 'syntax', 'bracket']
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle exceptions in Python, and what is the purpose of the 'finally' block?",
      idealAnswer: "Exceptions are handled using a try-except block. The 'try' block contains code that might raise an error. The 'except' block catches it. The 'finally' block executes cleanup code *always*, regardless of whether an exception was raised or caught.",
      keywords: ['try', 'except', 'exception', 'finally', 'error', 'raise', 'cleanup']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between *args and **kwargs in Python function definitions?",
      idealAnswer: "*args allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments (collected into a tuple). **kwargs allows a function to accept any number of keyword/named arguments (collected into a dictionary).",
      keywords: ['args', 'kwargs', 'positional', 'keyword', 'tuple', 'dictionary', 'argument']
    },
    {
      question: "What is the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) in Python, and how does it affect multi-threading?",
      idealAnswer: "The GIL is a mutex in CPython that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This makes multi-threading in Python unable to utilize multiple CPU cores for CPU-bound tasks, requiring multi-processing instead.",

    {
      question: "What is your understanding of RESTful API design principles, and how do you structure your endpoints?",
      idealAnswer: "RESTful principles model resources as nouns (e.g. /users) and use HTTP verbs for actions (GET to retrieve, POST to create, PUT/PATCH to edit, DELETE to delete). REST APIs are stateless, separating client and server concerns, and return standard status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error) and standard payloads.",

      question: "Could you explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, and when to choose which?",
      idealAnswer: "SQL databases are relational, use tables/schemas, support complex JOINs, and enforce ACID properties (ideal for structured transactions, finance). NoSQL databases are non-relational (document, key-value, graph), have dynamic schemas, scale horizontally, and are ideal for unstructured big data, real-time analytics, and rapid development.",

      question: "What is Git branching strategy, and how do you handle merge conflicts in a team?",
      idealAnswer: "Branching strategies (like GitFlow, GitHub Flow) organize development using feature branches merged into a main or develop branch via Pull Requests. To resolve merge conflicts: pull the latest target branch locally, merge it into your feature branch, resolve conflicting lines manually in code, stage, commit, and push the resolved code.",

      question: "How do you approach writing clean, testable code, and what is your view on Unit Testing?",
      idealAnswer: "Clean code adheres to SOLID principles, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and utilizes small, single-responsibility functions. Testable code avoids tight coupling and global state. Unit testing verifies isolated blocks (functions or classes) in mock environments, ensuring long-term code stability and fast bug detection during refactoring.",

Role / Seniority: ${difficulty} level in "${topic}".
Interview Language: ${language || 'en-IN'}${langMeta.instruction}

STRICT CONTEXT WINDOW & QUESTIONING DIRECTIVES:
1. MANDATORY CONVERSATIONAL INTERRELATION:
   - Every single question you ask MUST be directly interrelated with the candidate's previous response and conversation context window.
   - You MUST NOT ask disconnected, isolated textbook trivia questions.
   - Always demonstrate active listening by starting your question with a brief, natural conversational acknowledgement referencing a specific technical claim, architecture choice, or mechanism the candidate just mentioned (e.g., "You noted using X for Y...", "Building on your point regarding...", "In your explanation of...", "Given how you structured...").

2. RIGOROUS DOUBT COUNTERING & FAIR KNOWLEDGE ANALYSIS:
   - Carefully analyze the candidate's answer for technical ambiguity, hesitation (e.g., "maybe", "I guess", "probably", "I think"), superficial explanations, unverified claims, missing critical failure modes, or partial accuracy.
   - If there is DOUBT or AMBIGUITY in the candidate's response (and this specific question has not already received a counter-probe):
     * You MUST challenge that doubt with a targeted COUNTER-QUESTION in order to assure complete, fair knowledge analysis!
     * Set "isCounterQuestion": true
     * Set "doubtReason": 1 clear sentence describing the exact technical doubt or ambiguity detected.
     * In "question", formulate a sharp, constructive counter-question directly probing that doubtful point (e.g., "You mentioned X, but you seemed hesitant about Y—how would this behave under Z?", "You noted X, but how does that prevent race condition Y?").
     * Provide constructive guidance in "feedback".
     * Set "isComplete": false.
   - If the candidate's response is confident, thorough, and clear (OR if they have just clarified/answered a previous counter-question):
     * Set "isCounterQuestion": false.
     * Set "doubtReason": null.
     * Provide expert feedback in "feedback".
     * If nextIndex >= ${total}: Set "isComplete": true and provide a gracious closing remark in "question".
     * If not final: Set "isComplete": false and generate the next interrelated technical question probing architectural trade-offs, edge cases, or system design.

3. SKILL DOMAIN IDENTIFICATION:
   - Identify the competency skill domain associated with this question/answer (e.g., "Asynchronous Mechanics", "State Architecture", "Performance Optimization", "Error Resilience", etc.) and set in "skillDomain".

4. RESPONSE SCHEMA:
   Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object matching:

SCORING RULES (CRITICAL INTEGRITY):
1. Grade the answers strictly against the correct technical definitions of the concepts asked.
2. If candidate's answer is extremely short, irrelevant, gibberish, or says "I don't know", "skip", "pass", "मुझे कुछ नहीं पता", or left empty, award a score of EXACTLY 0.
3. Scoring Rubric for each question:
   - 90-100: Complete, accurate, detailed answer with deep technical terminology and code/architectural understanding.
   - 70-89: Generally correct, covers main definitions, but lacks detail or minor aspects are omitted.
   - 40-69: Partially correct or very brief, misses major definitions or concepts.
   - 1-39: Extremely brief or contains major technical inaccuracies.
   - 0: Empty, skipped, or equivalent to "I don't know" / non-responsive.
4. Total Expected Questions: The candidate was planned for ${targetTotal} total questions.
   - Total verbalScore MUST be (Sum of breakdown scores) / ${targetTotal}.
   - If candidate completed fewer questions or exited early, unattempted questions count as 0.
5. NEVER fabricate fake compliments (e.g., "candidate stayed calm", "polite response", "spoke in their chosen language") if technical knowledge was absent. If overall score is under 40 or answers were non-substantive, strengths MUST state "No verified technical competencies demonstrated in the submitted responses." and hiringRecommendation MUST be "No Hire".
6. If 'Tab switching warning violations count' is greater than 0, add a warning under 'improvements' stating: "Ensure compliance with interview guidelines (detected X tab changes)." where X is the count.`;

  const prompt = `Candidate: ${name}
Role / Seniority: ${difficulty} level mock interview for "${topic}".

VERBAL TECHNICAL INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT (ALL VERBAL QUESTIONS & CANDIDATE RESPONSES):
${formattedVerbalHistory || '(No verbal responses recorded)'}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Conduct an in-depth, fair knowledge analysis of the candidate's verbal responses. Note where the candidate had doubts or where the AI countered and gave them a chance to clarify.
2. Formulate the Formal Natural Evaluation Report with executiveSummary, knowledgeDepthAssessment, communicationAndClarity, hiringRecommendation, strengths, improvements, generalTips.
3. Construct the comprehensive Skill Map mapping the questions asked and candidate's responses into distinct competency domains with individual scores (0-100) and levels ("Master", "Proficient", "Developing", "Needs Review").
4. Score each question objectively under "breakdown" using the strict 0-100 rubric.
5. Return strictly valid JSON matching the systemPrompt schema.`;

  "confidence": "high" or "medium" or "low",
  "location": "brief description of where in frame, or null",
  "box_2d": [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax] or null

Rules & Guidelines:
- Pay extreme attention to the laptop display, laptop screen, and screen bezels. 
- Detect if a mobile phone is placed on, resting on, leaning against, or mounted on/near the laptop display, screen bezel, keyboard area, or desk nearby.
- Look for smartphones resting vertically or horizontally on the top, bottom, or sides of the laptop screen, which may show a camera bump, phone screen, side profile, or phone bezel.
- Set "mobile_detected" to true if ANY part of a phone is visible (screen, body, camera module, edge, or hand holding phone).
- Set "mobile_detected" to true if someone appears to be looking down at a device in their lap or off-screen.
- If "mobile_detected" is true, estimate the normalized bounding box coordinates [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax] of the phone in the 0-1000 range. E.g. [350, 420, 750, 850]. Set "box_2d" to null if not detected or uncertain.
- Set "mobile_detected" to false ONLY if there is absolutely no phone evidence or device visible.
- Do NOT explain. JSON only.`;
